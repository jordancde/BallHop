# BallHop
This project is an iOS game I have been working on over the past couple weeks. The goal of the game is to contiuously tap the ball for as long as possible, while the score is incremented with each tap. As certain score levels are achieved, new ball colors are introduced as acheivements. The app also features Game Center integrations for achievements and leaderboards. The game can be tested in browser by opening the www/index.html file (Without game center integration of course). To make any contributions regarding the platform, you will need to install the Ionic framework and its dependencies. Version 1.2 of the game is currently on the App Store and can be found here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ballhop!-endless-addictive/id1049513042?ls=1&mt=8
